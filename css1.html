     <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screem,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
     <li><span id="un">Css is not neccesary</span><span id="bg">CSS saves alot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>

    <h2 id="h2i">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul id="u">
   <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
   <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head sectionn</li>   
   <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS files.</li>
   <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span id="inu">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li> 
</ul>

<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
<p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has benn targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
